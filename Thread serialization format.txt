Threads are serialized as a sequence of packed values.

The first 3 values are the stack size in bytes (LargeInt), frame count (LargeInt), and journal count (LargeInt).

After the initial info, each frame is stored, starting with the entry-level frame.  The frame info consists of 4 values:
- The current method
- The current internal IL instruction index (LargeInt, NOT the RDX IL instruction index)
- The frame BP offset (LargeInt)
- The frame PRV offset (LargeInt)

After the frame info, each journal is stored:
- The type of the journal value
- The offset of the journal value on the stack (LargeInt)
- A flag indicating whether or not the journal is a pointer (Bool)
- A flag indicating whether or not the journal is a varying (Bool)
