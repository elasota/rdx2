CObject: Anything that can potentially be resolved via CompileExpression.  Doesn't necessarily resolve into values, can be things like properties, types, and method groups
    ValueExpression: Includes .vtams and implements IValueExpression
    CompilableValueExpression: Implements IValueExpression and ICompilable
    CompilableObject: Implements ICompilable
        VType: VTypes
            StructuredTypeObject (etc.)

SimpleCompilable: Implements ICompilable, nothing else


ICompilable: Capable of being compiled during multipass.  Has bool Compile(CompilerState) and bool isCompiled intercepts
IValueExpression: Has .vtams
