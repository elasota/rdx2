Thread suspension has varying results based on the traceability of the thread's functions.

All functions in a thread stack can have one of three tracing qualities:
- Fully traced: Thread can be serialized and garbage collected
- Reference traced: Thread can be garbage collected
- Untraced: Prevents serialization and garbage collection

Garbage collection can't scan untraced functions and will block if any threads contain one in its call stack.
Threads can't be serialized unless every function in the stack is fully traced.
